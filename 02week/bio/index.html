            <p>What I cannot do: play musical instruments (yes, this includes the triangle); paint; sing; dance; successfully remember braille, or Morse Code (except for S.O.S.). What I can do: solve puzzles (chess, anyone?); find minute errors; create solutions; improvise (not comedically). How do I know this about myself? Because I have tried each one of the activities in the preceding lists, and many more. Through trial and error, I have discovered what I like and what I don’t like, and what I’m good at and what might not be my forte.</p>
            <p>I love coding. And, I’m good at it. Perhaps you can help me turn this passion into a career!</p>
